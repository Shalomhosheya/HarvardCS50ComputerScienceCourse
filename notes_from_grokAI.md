### Week 4: Memory

-   **Main Focus**: Managing memory in C.
-   **Key Concepts**:
    -   Pointers, address-of (&), dereference (\*).

    -   Tools: Valgrind for memory leaks.
-   **Lecture Highlights**: Memory as a grid; pointers explained with analogies.
-   **Problem Set 4**: Apply image filters (grayscale, sepia, etc.), recover deleted JPEGs from raw data.
-   **Tips**: Pointers are key—misuse causes seg faults. Practice with small examples.
